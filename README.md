This is a forked project in which I automated the build and deployment with Jenkins, connected the backend with Mongodb Atlas cloud service.
I also deployed the local project to the cloud using the render cloud hosting platform.
I also integrated a slack plugin to configure a slack bot in slack to push the deployment link to a slack channel of my choosing.
